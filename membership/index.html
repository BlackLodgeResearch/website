<p>So, you have visited the space and want to become a member of Black Lodge Research?  That is great, and we are as excited as you are!</p>
<p>Black Lodge Research is sponsored by Social Good Fund, a 501(c)3 charitable organization, and promotes continued education and community for many different subject matters. And we would love to have more members that share our goals!</p>
<p>The membership process has a few steps involved, starting with the links below.</p>
<h2 id="membership-process" tabindex="-1">Membership Process</h2>
<p>First, filling out the form below with your relevant details will allow us to get the ball rolling.  Details for how the process works are outlined in the form.</p>

<p>Second, becoming a member also entails a commitment to a small monthly contribution to helping keep BLR running and open for all to come and learn.  There are many rewarding benefits to this, like a custom Email @ <a href="http://BlackLodgeResearch.org">BlackLodgeResearch.org</a>, a key once probationary period has passed, as well as first access to BLR swag and potentially rack space in the lodge.</p>
