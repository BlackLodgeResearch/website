# Black Lodge Research Website generator
This is a static website generator for the Black Lodge Research website, using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), which is a Node.js package.

[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/BlackLodgeResearch/website/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/BlackLodgeResearch/website/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml)

## Getting Started Editing
See any directory under `src` for the files that need to be edited, with the exception of the `_includes` directory, which holds the templating files.

## Local testing
`npm run dev` will run the server locally. When you're done editing, a commit to the main branch will trigger a build and deploy to GitHub pages.
